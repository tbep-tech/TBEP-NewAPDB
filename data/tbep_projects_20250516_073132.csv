861,FL Friendly Landscape Program and Assistance with Irrigation-Landscape Ordinances,"Tampa Bay Water supplies wholesale drinking water to Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas Counties, and the Cities of New Port Richey, St. Petersburg and Tampa. Tampa Bay Water and its predecessor agency began annual funding for a landscape and irrigation system design, installation and maintenance program with a focus on non-point source pollution reduction. In 1995, funding was provided through contracts for staff positions in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties; in 1998, the program expanded to include a full-time position for Pasco County. In 2001, Tampa Bay Water began coordination of a model landscape and irrigation ordinance that was used by four Member Governments to adopt similar ordinances. A comprehensive evaluation of landscape and irrigation ordinance implementation (includes use of Florida-friendly landscape techniques) was completed in 2005, and implementation was coordinated with affected Member Governments, the Southwest Florida Water Management District and the Florida Irrigation Society. In August of 2017, as a result of work done in Pasco County on new development, the Tampa Bay Water Board of Directors directed the Agency to evaluate all member government landscape and irrigation ordinances, and to make recommendations on potential changes to further enhance water conservation and efficiency aspects.

The Florida Friendly Landscape Program (formerly titled Florida Yards and Neighborhoods) is a multi-curriculum water conservation program developed to accentuate existing Member Government programs and focuses on nine landscape principles including water use efficiency. The overall program goal is to foster a sense of environmental stewardship among citizens by increasing awareness and understanding of natural systems and resources, and how they relate to ecology, economy and quality of life. This is accomplished through a coordinated hands-on environmental education program promoting responsible actions by homeowners, builders, businesses, homeownersâ€™ associations and others to conserve water and improve water quality by reducing polluted runoff from yards and other landscaped areas. The Florida Friendly Landscape Program emphasizes designing, installing and retrofitting existing landscapes to more Florida friendly landscapes that lead to increases in water use efficiency. Program materials developed promote the concepts of water conservation, environmental enhancement, and pollution prevention, and it is well received by the public throughout the region and state. 

Florida Friendly Landscape Program funding affects all areas in the Tampa Bay region, and agreements between Tampa Bay Water and the program are administered through Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas counties. Each county provides, at a minimum, an overall program coordinator and a public education coordinator focusing on water use efficiency-related program elements who work through their respective local Extension Service office.  The Agreement requires overall coordination and oversight from individual county advisory committees, Extension Service horticulture agents, annual report generation, plan-of-work and expenditure approvals, specific coordination meetings with member governments, and identification of the effectiveness of the overall program and the public education component specifically. A multi-county advisory committee serves to enhance program focus with member governments, other local governments and specific private sector entities. The Hillsborough County program includes coordination and development of the tri-county annual (water year) report which is produced each fall.",Tampa Bay Water, 250-500 K,27.79,-82.442,All Segments,Hybrid,Completed,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0

Tampa Bay Water assisted the Florida Irrigation Society with creation of a site manager certification program that was used to train personnel that manage large landscape and irrigation systems.  The program provided continuing education units for permit enforcement staff training on landscape and irrigation ordinance review.

In accordance with the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences recommendation, the Florida Irrigation Society is now promoting the national Irrigation Association irrigation auditor training program and Tampa Bay Waterâ€™s former project has been discontinued. In the future, there is continued potential to modify existing landscape and irrigation codes to increase water use efficiency in new and existing development, and Tampa Bay Water will be involved in some aspect of training.",Tampa Bay Water,Not Listed,28.019236,-82.21548,All Segments,Hybrid,Planned,2004.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0
863,Smart Water Application Technologies Workshop and Training,"Tampa Bay Water supplies wholesale drinking water to Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas Counties, and the Cities of New Port Richey, St. Petersburg and Tampa. To promote water conservation and enhance water use efficiency for new and existing development in the Tampa Bay region, Tampa Bay Water funds the Florida Friendly Landscape program encouraging the installation of water efficient landscapes and irrigation for new and existing development (see ID 861), along with support for development of related technology. As the use of tested and verified technology is a key component to increasing efficiency of water use, Tampa Bay Water also funds an annual University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS) Smart Water Applications Technology workshop.

Tampa Bay Water co-sponsors this workshop with the Florida Irrigation Society (FIS) and IFAS, with the FIS coordinating invitations to irrigation and building contractors along with sponsorships from irrigation vendors. Member government conservation staff along with Florida Friendly Landscape Program staff are also invited to attend. The FIS coordinates the provision of Continuing Education Units (CEUs) for contractors. Improved irrigation practices and measurement approaches help use limited water resources more efficiently, and can also improve water quality by reducing polluted runoff from yards and other landscaped areas. In addition to advancing development of water use efficiency-related technology, this workshop provides an important educational and networking opportunity for irrigation and building contractors, vendors, researchers and local government staff.",Tampa Bay Water,   5-25 K,27.826351,-82.752508,All Segments,Hybrid,Completed,2003.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0

865,Hydrobiological Monitoring Program,"Tampa Bay Water operates a large interconnected system including groundwater, river withdrawals, a reservoir 
and seawater desalination to provide drinking water for more than 2 million people in the Tampa Bay region. 
Tampa Bay Waterâ€™s Hydrobiological Monitoring Programs (HBMP) were designed and implemented to monitor 
water quality, vegetation, habitat, fish, wildlife and recreational/aesthetic conditions in the lower Hillsborough 
River, Alafia River, McKay Bay/ Tampa Bypass Canal, as well as Hillsborough Bay, and includes nearshore 
monitoring in the Apollo Beach/Big Bend area. Types of data that have been collected include water quality, fish 
and plankton sampling, bird surveys, and vegetation monitoring.  Monitoring activities are coordinated with 
other local environmental monitoring agencies.

Tampa Bay Waterâ€™s HBMP has ensured that water supply projects have not adversely impacted river or Bay 
resources, and have provided comprehensive monitoring data to increase the scientific understanding of these 
estuarine systems. HBMP data have been used by the Southwest Florida Water Management District for MFLs 
and other studies, the University of South Floridaâ€™s College of Marine Science and the Florida Wildlife Research 
Institute. Several cooperative projects have also been completed by Tampa Bay Water with USEPA, the TBEP 
and others to help address specific data or information needs for Bay managers.

Current HBMP data collection and evaluation focuses on ambient water quality conditions and watershed 
linkages: continuous water quality recorder measurements, in situ water quality profiles, continuous chlorophyll

866,Wellfield Environmental Management Programs,"Tampa Bay Water operates a large interconnected system including groundwater, river withdrawals, a reservoir 
and seawater desalination to provide drinking water for more than 2 million people in the Tampa Bay region. 
Groundwater continues to be a vital part of the Tampa Bay regionâ€™s water supply, with more than 50 percent of 
the regional supply coming from wellfields. Some of the wellfields in Tampa Bay Waterâ€™s system have been 
pumping groundwater for over 50 years. Though groundwater pumping has been drastically cut back, in the 
past very high rates of pumping from these wellfields contributed to lower water levels in some of the regionâ€™s 
lakes and wetlands.

Wellfield environmental management plans (EMP) including hydrological and ecological monitoring have been 
implemented for wetlands, streams and lakes in all Tampa Bay Water wellfield areas in the Tampa Bay 
watershed.  EMPs are designed to monitor and evaluate hydrological and ecological conditions in relation to 
potential environmental perturbations that could occur naturally (e.g., climatic events or biotic disturbances) or 
from human activity (e.g., wellfield production, ditching, or drainage).  EMP data collection and analysis includes 
water levels, wetland health, stream and spring discharge, water quality, rainfall and evaporation, 
qualitative/quantitative vegetation data evaluation, incidental wildlife observations, and aerial photo-
interpretation of land use and ecological changes. EMP data are used by Tampa Bay Water, the SWFWMD, and 
other environmental researchers for minimum flows and levels studies, development of remote sensing tools for 
impact monitoring, and the identification of key monitoring indicators.

Reduced wellfield pumping has resulted in higher groundwater levels and environmental recovery in some 
impacted lakes and wetlands. Tampa Bay Water is also preparing a comprehensive Recovery Assessment Plan 
that includes assessment of environmental recovery due to pumping cutbacks, and identification and evaluation 
of potential options to address any remaining impacts. As this is the first assessment of its kind in Florida, 
Tampa Bay Water is working closely with the Southwest Florida Water Management District to develop and apply 
specific data collection and assessment methods to determine environmental recovery from reduced 
groundwater pumping, including assessment of development-related wetland impacts associated with surface 
drainage and land-use changes. Completion of the Recovery Assessment Plan is scheduled for December 2018.",Tampa Bay Water,Not Listed,28.019236,-82.21548,Hillsborough Bay,Hybrid,Completed,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0
867,Source Water Protection - Land Use and Development Review Program,"Tampa Bay Waters Land Use and Development Proposal Review Program (Program) is an ad-hoc program, 
intended to help protect the agencyâ€™s drinking water supply sources by reviewing member governments land 
use/rezoning applications and mining/borrow pit applications, providing technical and planning analysis, and 
suggesting development conditions for those developments that pose the most threat to agencys drinking 
water supply sources. The program initially started in the 1980s with the review of Developments of Regional 
Impacts documents to determine where suitable future groundwater supplies might be developed consistent 
with regional forecasts for growth. The program evolved over the years and Tampa Bay Water staff have 
provided assistance to member governments for development of local wellhead and source water protection 
ordinances. The Land Use and Development Proposal Review Program currently includes review of proposed 
development projects under member government wellhead and surface water protection ordinances, rezoning 
applications, and mining and borrow pit applications.",Tampa Bay Water,Not Listed,27.79,-82.442,All Segments,Hybrid,Completed,2003.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0
868,Source Water Monitoring Programs,"Tampa Bay Water operates a large interconnected system including groundwater, river withdrawals, a reservoir

Tampa Bay Waterâ€™s Source Water Monitoring Programs include watershed/water quality monitoring, source 
vulnerability assessments with identification of potential contaminant sources, and development of a 
standardized GIS-based platform and information system to facilitate data assessment and risk mitigation 
activities.  

Tampa Bay Waterâ€™s Source Water Monitoring Programs include waterbody and tributary monitoring, and discrete 
and continuous water quality data collected by Tampa Bay Water and different local, state and federal entities. 
General monitoring objectives including source reliability, operational needs, short and long-term trend 
analyses, and assessment of changing watershed conditions. Tampa Bay Water has implemented a 
comprehensive GIS platform and information system to improve source water assessment, data management 
and analysis. This system dynamically links regularly updated federal, state and local databases for different 
potential contaminant sources, chemical risk information and water quality monitoring data, and facilitates 
assessment and reporting. Enhanced data assessment and risk management considerations are being 
addressed through special studies with the Water Research Foundation and other organizations.",Tampa Bay Water,Not Listed,28.019236,-82.21548,Hillsborough Bay,Hybrid,Completed,2004.0,2021.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0

1402,Tampa Bay Water Stormwater Systems,"Tampa Bay Water operates a large interconnected system including groundwater, river withdrawals, a reservoir 
and seawater desalination to provide drinking water for more than 2 million people in the Tampa Bay region. 
Tampa Bay Water operates and maintains 18 stormwater systems for different types of facilities that are part of 
the regional drinking water system.  These stormwater systems or structural best management practices (BMP), 
are designed for flood control and water quality improvement, and include stormwater ponds (wet and dry), 
grassed swales or ditches, infiltration basins, and inlet/outfall structures associated with each system.

Periodic inspections are performed for all systems, and maintenance is performed to maintain design functions 
and BMP goals. Typical maintenance activities include as-needed mowing and aquatic vegetation management, 
structure inspection and clean-out, and removal of litter, debris and accumulated sediments. Tampa Bay Water 
has developed a GIS database for stormwater systems to facilitate tracking and perform maintenance activities 
more effectively. Appropriate maintenance of stormwater systems maintains and may increase nutrient loading 
reductions, and is important for water quality within basins and tributaries that discharge to Tampa Bay. Total 
nitrogen load reductions associated with enhanced maintenance activities have not been established at this 
time, but may be developed for future project updates.",Tampa Bay Water,,28.024735,-82.315026,Hillsborough Bay,Hybrid,Ongoing,2015.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0

1465,East Lake Channel Nutrient Removal,"Sediment accumulation within the residential canals of East Lake has occurred through organic sediment deposition and channel slope erosion.

Contractor will develop and perform a work plan for the physical removal of accumulated muck within East Lake channels (wet or dry process), taking into account potential debris (boats, dock, trash, etc.) within the channels.  The assumed muck depth layer is 2’ from the East Lake Nutrient Source Study analysis, with the channels measureing at lenths of 2300’ (east channel) and 1,200’ (west channel).  Estimated TP load reduction associated with dredging the channel is approximately 1,636 lbs.  This is based on the assumed field conditions during the study, and an organic sediment volume that was estimated to be 4.67 acre-ft (approximately 7551 cubic yards).",Hillsborough County,500K-1M,0.0,0.0,Hillsborough Bay,Hybrid,Completed,0.0,2022.0,0.0,2022.0,,14.672,,14.672
